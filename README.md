# Stock-Analysis
## Overview
Used VBA to analyze an excel data set containing various stocks for the years 2017 and 2018, and their opening and closing prices. This enabled us to see which stocks were worth investing and provided us with reference points through 2017 and 2018. We then refactored our code to be able to analyze thousands of stocks at the click of a button, and reduced the time it took to run the code.
## Results
Our findings were as follows:
- In **2017**, all stocks with the exception of TERP had a *positive* return.
- In **2018**, all stocks with the exception of ENPH and RUN had a *negative* return.
- By refactoring our code, we decreased the amount of time for the year:
  - 2017 by .5859375 seconds
  - 2018 by .6015625 seconds

 ## Summary
 There were advantages and disadvantages to refactoring our code. The main advantage was that our code was able to run quicker, more efficiently, and can be used for larger data sets. The main disadvantage was that we had to use more complex coding and this potentially could lead to more problems when executing the code. With our refactored code, we were able to help people make informed decisions on which stocks would be worth investing in, based on prior years data.
